This is a fork of the original G4EMMA simulation. The main changes were to update the version of Geant4 as several versions have gone by since this was done last. There are numerous edits, most are minor. The main difference is that the LHEP physics models had long since been deprecated and needed to be replaced. I saw no reason not to use the recommended defaults (such as G4HadsronPhysicsFTFP_BERT).

This simulation compiled and ran succesfullly with:
OS: Debian 12
Root version: 6.32.08
Geant4 version: 11.3.2

Follow the instructions in the original repo for installation.
